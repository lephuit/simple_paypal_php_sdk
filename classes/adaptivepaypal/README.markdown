# PayPal Adaptive Payments PHP Package With Namespaces by [Jason Michels] (http://thebizztech.com/)

This package is being built in tandem with an equivalent package that can be used in Codeigniter.

The purpose of this is to provide much of the PayPal Adaptive payments functionality in a simple PHP namespaced package.

There is one depencency to use this package, a curl library I built.  I will post a link to that package soon.
